## Introduction

A maximum flow problem is a widely known example of an optimization problem. The goal is to find the maximum possible flow in a network where the connections between the nodes (the arcs or edges) have a limited capacity. It is a very recognizable situation, for instance a railway or highway network that leads trains or cars to connected cities, or channels transporting water to linked reservoirs. In fact, the problem was first formulated by Harris and Ross in the context of the military evaluation of a railway network capacity and the effectiveness of taking out one or more rail lines in order to stop hostile transports [^1]. Furthermore, many recurring problems are related to maximum flow problems and can thus be solved if a solution to the corresponding maximum flow problem exists.

It is clear that such a recognizable and applicable problem is studied thoroughly and multiple solution methods, algorithms and applications have been developed.
In this notebook first some definitions and terminology of the maximum flow problem are explained. Further one of the first solving methods, the Ford-Fulkerson method, is studied, implemented and illustrated on a toy example. At last some real-life applications are shown.

## Definitions

To be able to completely understand the problem, some definitions and terminology are needed.

!!! terminology "Capacitated network"
    A *capacitated network* is a network ``G`` with *nodes* ``N`` and *arcs* ``A``, noted as ``G = (N,A)``, with a *capacity* ``u_{i,j}`` for the arc ``(i,j) \in A``. In this notebook the network is implemented as an ``n \times n`` adjacency matrix ``A``, with ``n`` the number of nodes in ``N`` and where ``A[i,j] = u_{i,j}``. Say an arc ``(i,j) \in A`` exists if ``A[i,j] > 0`` and the corresponding capacity is ``u_{i,j}``.

There are two special nodes: the source ``s`` and sink ``t``. In each node of the network there should be a correct mass balance, i.e. what comes in has to go out, except for the source and sink. The source can create flow and the sink can consume it.

There are two examples implemented to illustrate the concepts in this section. Select one using the dropdown menu.

!!! terminology "Flow and value of flow"
    A *flow* ``x`` is in this case defined as a matrix with elements ``x_{i,j}`` representing the sent flow on the arc ``(i,j)`` from node ``i`` to ``j``. The *flow* ``x`` is a proposed solution to the maximum flow problem, but not necessarily the best. The *value of the flow* ``v`` can be calculated by taking the sum of the flows of the arcs leaving the source (``x_{s,i}``) or arriving at the sink (``x_{i,t}``).

The maximum flow problem can then formally be written as:

maximize ``v``, subject to:

```math
\sum_{(i,j) \in A} x_{i,j} \text{ -} \sum_{(i,j) \in A} x_{j,i} = \begin{cases} v & \text{for } i = s, \\ 0 & \text{for all } i \in N \setminus \{s,t\} \\ -v & \text{for } i = t. \end{cases}
```
and
```math
0 \leq x_{i,j} \leq u_{i,j}  \hspace{2em} \text{for each } (i,j) \in A
``` 

Furthermore the problem is subject to some assumptions:

* The network is directed
* All capacities are strictly positive integers
* There is no directed path from ``s`` to ``t`` existing of infinite capacity arcs, otherwise the maximum flow would be infinite
* If there is an arc ``(i,j)``, there can also be an arc ``(j,i)``
* There are no parallel arcs (an arc with the same source and sink node).

At last, a critical concept in the following algorithm is the residual network. It is a network with adapted capacities, containing the remainder of the capacities of the original network that can still be sent given a current flow ``x``. For example if there is an arc ``(i,j)`` with capacity 8 but along which 5 flow units are already sent, the residual capacity will be 3. Furthermore the residual network has the ability to cancel sent flow, so there is an extra arc ``(j,i)`` with capacity 5.

!!! terminology "Residual network"
    A *residual network* given a flow ``x``, ``G(x)``, exists of the *residual capacities* ``r_{i,j}`` from a network ``G``. The residual capacity of an arc ``(i,j) \in A`` is the maximal additional flow that can be sent from node ``i`` to ``j`` using the arcs ``(i,j)`` and ``(j,i)``, so ``r_{i,j} = u_{i,j} - x_{i,j} + x_{j,i}``. It consists of two parts: the unused capacity ``u_{i,j} - x_{i,j}`` of arc ``(i,j)`` and the current flow ``x_{j,i}`` on arc ``(j,i)``, which can be canceled to increase the flow ``x_{i,j}`` on arc ``(i,j)``.

The residual network of the example above, given a flow 
``x`` is shown below.

## Ford-Fulkerson method [^2]

### Method

The Ford-Fulkerson method is the first method that was developed to solve this kind of problem and is rather intuitive. It is a greedy method, also known as the augmenting path algorithm and guarantees to find a maximum flow if the network consists of arcs with integer, finite capacities.

It starts with calculating the residual network of a capacitated network given a flow (which is initially zero) as described above. Then it searches this residual network for existing augmenting paths, that is a path from source to sink of which all residual capacities are larger than zero. The residual capacity of an augmenting path is defined as the minimum residual capacity of the arcs in the path. If such a path exists, the residual capacity is by definition positive, so it can be added to the flow along each arc in the augmenting path. This proces is repeated until no augmenting paths can be found.

Note that it is not mentioned how the augmenting paths can be found, therefore it is called a **method** instead of an algorithm. A frequently used search algorithm to find these augmenting paths is the breadth-first search, which finds a shortest path in a network (in terms of number of arcs in the path). When this search algorithm is used in the Ford-Fulkerson method, the algorithm is called the Edmonds-Karp algorithm and it solves the maximum flow problem in maximally ``\mathcal{O}(na^2)`` time, where ``n`` and ``a`` are the number of nodes and arcs respectively. It works as follows.
The distinction is made between labeled and unlabeled nodes, where a labeled node is already visited and an unlabeled not. Further a queue is used, containing the nodes of which the neighboring nodes still have to be explored. Starting with the source, which is labeled and added to the queue, all the unlabeled nodes connected to it with an arc with a larger than zero residual capacity, are labeled and added at the back of the queue. Subsequently the source is removed from the queue and the first node in the queue is further explored. The algorithm stops if the sink gets labeled, or if all the nodes are labeled and there are no nodes left in the queue, which means there is no augmenting path. Because for each labeled node it is memorised which parent node led to it's labeling, the path can be reconstructed using backtracking.

### Pseudocode 

The pseudocode of both algorithms is shown below and implemented in respectively `augmenting_path` and `bfs`.

#### Augmenting path algorithm
1. Initialize zero flow.
2. Calculate the residual network.
3. Search the residual network for an augmenting path.
4. If such a path exists:
    * Define the minimum residual capacity of the arcs in the path
    * Add this to the flow along each arc in the path
    * Repeat steps 2 - 3.
5. If not, stop the algorithm.

#### Breadth-first search
1. Unlabel all nodes and initialize an empty queue and an empty parent array.
2. Label the source and add it to the queue.
3. As long as the sink is not labeled and the queue is not empty:
    * Remove the first node from the queue and explore all the nodes connected to it with a non-zero residual capacity arc.
        * If the neighboring node is unlabeled, label it and add it at the end of the queue. 
        * Save the node that is currently being explored as the parent node.
        * If it is already labeled, go on to the next neighboring node.
4. If the sink is labeled, a path is found, otherwise an augmenting path does not exist.

### Example
The example above is used to illustrate the augmenting path algorithm. First the original network is shown. Below you can see the different steps at each iteration of the algorithm. The augmenting path in the residual network is indicated by orange nodes.

## Applications
At last two real-life applications of the maximum flow problem are shown to prove its practical abilities.

### Feasible flow [^2]
The first application is the most physically interpretable. The goal is to send a defined amount of flow from one or multiple sources to one or multiple sinks. If this is not possible given the capacitated network, the flow is not feasible. An extra constraint can be the amount of flow the sink(s) need(s) to receive, in case this is known. To illustrate this problem, the following setting is used:

Suppose it is the day of *De Ronde van Vlaanderen* (the Tour of Flanders), a famous road cycling race in the UCI World Tour. The finish is in Oudenaarde, a small city in the Flemish Ardens surrounded by challenging climbs. Of course a lot of cycling fans want to see their hero crossing the finish line first and they are taking the train from their home city to Oudenaarde. The following network represents a simplified railway map from the SNCB with some (major) cities in Flanders [^3]. The capacities are illustrative and represent the capacities of the trains riding between 2 cities on a normal day.

Say the huge cycling fans live in Bruges, Kortrijk, Antwerp and Brussels. These cities are considered sources and of course Oudenaarde is the sink. This means that in the other cities, no extra people can get on the train. Furthermore it is known how many fans want to get from the source cities to the finish. In Bruges there are 600 fans, in Kortrijk 500, in Antwerp 300 and in Brussels 800.

The feasible flow problem translates into the question: **Is it possible to let all the passengers go from their home city to their desired destination?**
This can be solved by adding a node in the network with arcs to each source. The capacities of these arcs are the number of passengers that have to get on the train in each home city. Calculating the maximum flow in this extended network gives the answer on the question. This is implemented in the function `augmenting_path` by giving an extra argument `send`.

!!! note
	The trick of adding an extra node in front and/or at the end of the network can 	also be used to solve a maximum flow problem with multiple sources and/or sinks, 	 by giving the arcs from the extra node(s) to the sources and/or sinks unlimited 	 capacities (practically implemented as very large integers).

Here an annoying side-effect of the use of multiple sources comes up. Normally there won't be any flow going to a source (this would be useless and inefficient) because it will be canceled by outgoing flow originating in the source. But because in the algorithm with multiple sources an extra node is added to serve as the temporary source, the real sources are handled like normal nodes and thus can serve as a connecting node in a path. Here this is the case for a path from Brussels to Oudernaarde that passes through Bruges. To make the flow more efficient, an auxiliary function `clean!` can be used to clean up the resulting flow.

Apparently there are 200 fans from Brussels that can't reach their destination.
But because it is a special day, the SNCB is willing to add extra railway carriages to improve the capacities of the lines.

As an expert in maximum flow problems, you can advise the SNCB on which line they should allow a suggested number of extra passengers to make it possible that everyone can attend the finish.

At last it is possible that the organization of the Tour of Flanders limits the number of spectators that can attend the finish. If there is for instance only place for 2000 spectators in Oudenaarde, the network can be extended with a new sink node, receiving the maximum number of visitors allowed as the arc capacity from the original sink (note that inhabitants of Oudenaarde, or people who do not come by train are not counted).

### Distributed computing on a two-processor computer [^4]

Suppose you have a computer with two (not necessarily identical) processors on which you want to run a rather complex program consisting of four modules. Each module ``i`` can be allocated to one of the two processors, resulting in a computing cost ``\alpha_i`` or ``\beta_i`` if it is allocated to processor 1 or 2 respectively. The modules can be run on a different processor, but some modules need to communicate with each other. If two modules ``i`` and ``j`` need to communicate, but are allocated to two different processors, an extra cost ``c_{i,j}`` needs to be accounted for. The goal is to minimize the computational cost by distributing the different modules of the program over the two processors in an optimal way.

The computing cost of module ``i`` run by processor 1 or 2 is given in this table:

|``i`` | a | b | c | d |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|``\alpha_i`` | 6 | 5 | 10 | 4 |
|``\beta_i`` | 4 | 10 | 3 | 8 |

The communication cost between the different modules is given in this matrix:

```math
\{c_{i,j}\} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 5 & 0 & 0 \\
5 & 0 & 6 & 2 \\
0 & 6 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 2 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
```

This problem can be translated to a network as follows. The matrix above is used as a network representing the flow between the modules. Further the source ``s`` and sink ``t`` nodes are added, representing processor 1 and 2 respectively. From the source there is an arc with capacity ``\beta_i`` to each module. Moreover there is an arc from each module to the sink with capacity ``\alpha_i``. The resulting network with modules ``a``, ``b``, ``c`` and ``d`` and processors 1 and 2 is shown below.

To solve the problem, first some extra concepts in graph theory are needed.

!!! terminology "s-t cut"
    A *cut* is a partition of the node set ``N`` into two subsets ``S`` and ``\bar{S} = N\setminus S``. If `` s \in S`` and ``t \in \bar{S}`` it is called an *s-t cut*. Arcs ``(i,j)`` with ``i \in S`` and ``j \in \bar{S}`` are called *forward arcs* of the cut and if ``j \in S`` and ``i \in \bar{S}``, arc ``(i,j)`` is called a *backward arc*.

!!! terminology "Capacity of an s-t cut"
    The *capacity of an s-t cut* is the sum of the capacities of the forward arcs in the cut.

!!! terminology "Minimum cut"
    A *minimum cut* is an s-t cut whose capacity is minimum among all the s-t cuts in a network.

From these definitions it is clear that thanks to the specific construction of the network, the total computational cost of an assignment of modules to different processors is given by the capacity of an s-t cut and the problem is in fact a **min-cut problem**. This can be illustrated with the following example cut. Let ``S = \{a,b\}`` and ``\bar{S} = \{c,d\}``. In the table above, it can be seen that the computational cost of running module ``a`` on processor 1 is equal to 6 and this is equal to the capacity of the upper right edge that is cut by the red line. This can be checked for each module. Further ``c`` and ``d`` have to communicate with ``b``, so two additional costs of 6 and 2 respectively are added (note that double arcs are counted only once). The total cost of this cut is ``8+3+6+2+5+6 = 30``.

To make the link with the maximum flow problem, the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem is used [^5].

!!! terminology "Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem"
    The maximal flow value obtainable in a capacitated network G is the minimum cut among all s-t cuts.

This means that every min-cut problem can be transformed to a maximum flow problem. Thus by calculating the maximum flow of the above network, we can determine the minimum computational cost. 

We can derive the allocation of the modules to the ``S`` or ``\bar{S}`` partition using the residual network given the maximum flow, ``G(x_{max})``. A node is part of ``S`` if it is reachable from ``s`` in ``G(x_{max})``, otherwise it is in ``\bar{S}``.
